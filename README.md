# MeanChess
Discrete, dishonourable, and semi-automatic Lichess cheat engine. Especially optimized for blitz and bullet games.

## Install
* The code in `meanChess.js` is a Tampermonkey userscript. 
* `chess_server.py` is a Flask server using `python-chess` for chess programming utilities. Run it using `python chess_server.py`. Before doing so, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Change `PATH_TO_STOCKFISH` to your local Stockfish engine.

## Usage
The control panel will present itself at the bottom of the page during a Lichess game. Follow the instructions given. MeanChess supports "Discrete mode" in which the player is given two arrows. The green arrow will always represent the best move given a position whilst the blue arrow is an good move at best, and a mistake at worst. If the player wishes to only get the best move once, they may press the "Get move" button.  

MeanChess does not work when playing anonymously.

## Bugs
1. May stop working when making many premoves in succession. Solution: Press "Stop" followed by "Start Cheat". Alternatively, get gud.
2. Arrows may not have arrowheads. Solution: Draw an arrow.
3. The first suggestion might show best move for opponent. This only happens once.

The mentioned bugs occur in Chrome, and I have yet to see 1 and 2 in Firefox and Firefox forks.

## Depth recommendation
Based on time vs. best move trade-offs.
| Gamemode | Depth |
| ------:| -----------:|
| Bullet       | 0.1 s |
| Blitz        | 1 s |
| $\geq$ Rapid | +3 s |
